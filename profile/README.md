## ✈️ TechN'Travels: East Africa Dev Journeys

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for TechN'Travels!

We are a specialized platform dedicated to connecting and empowering the developer community across East Africa. We handle all the logistics—from travel and accommodation to visa support—so that developers can focus on what matters: attending the region's top tech conferences and networking events.

Our mission is to lower the friction of intra-African travel for tech professionals, accelerating career growth and strengthening regional collaboration.

### 🌍 Our Core Focus

We are focused on supporting developers traveling between the major tech hubs of East Africa, specifically:

- Uganda 🇺🇬

- Kenya 🇰🇪

- Rwanda 🇷🇼

- Tanzania 🇹🇿 (Future Expansion)

### Built by Insiders, for Insiders

TechN'Travels was founded by a team of two Google Developer Experts (GDEs) who intimately understand the pain points of event travel in the region. Our platform is built on real-world community experience and technical expertise.
